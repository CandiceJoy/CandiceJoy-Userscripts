# TODO

1. Move local file definitions from source files to gulpfile (or somewhere else)
2. Add linting for TS (Before or after compile??? Both? O.o Try to interrupt compile before, I guess?)
3. Move linting to happen after compile, not before...that way it includes....includes
4. Can use JSHint if you lint TS after compile and not before...food for thought
5. Change JSHint to ESLint (.eslintrc.json already setup)
